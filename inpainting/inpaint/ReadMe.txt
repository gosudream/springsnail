inpaint.cpp: contains the main function, which specifies the input image name. In this case, it is "test.bmp". My program doesn't use "original.bmp". The image is put here only to show the original image.
You can adjust the input in inpaint.cpp.

inpainting.h/inpainting.cpp: my functions to inpaint the input image. All of the funtions have been documented.
image.h/image.cpp: an image library borrowed from others, which only helps me load the image and get pixels' color.
